## Project Overview

Study Site: Research was split between two different zones within the greater Yasuni Biosphere Reserve. Tiputini Biodiversity Station (TBS) served as the faunally intact site, whereas Yasuni Research Station (YRS) served as the defaunated site. Both sites are situated along the Tiputini River within the province of Orellana, Ecuador. TBS, approximately 45 km east of YRS, is only accessible by boat. YRS is along the Maxus Oil Road, and is less integrated into the Amazonian ecosystem. Additionally, unsustainable hunting activities by the indigenous communities have been prominent in the surrounding region at YRS for multiple decades, as noted from 2014. This is thought to be the root cause of defaunation in this zone. 

	I transferred between the two research stations every two weeks, starting my first rotation at TBS on June 10. Time at each station was spent working on 3 separate projects: my herpetofauna surveys, frugivory surveys, and an overarching seed enemy and dispersal project. 

	The rainy season in Northeastern Ecuador is at its peak between March and July. I conducted my study between the months of June and August, 2024. The average high temperature for June in this region is 85.66° F, with the average low of 70.05° F. July has an average high temperature of 86.29° F and an average low of 69.13° F. August has an average high temperature of 91.35° F and an average low of 69.60° F. June receives 143mm of precipitation on average each year, whereas July receives 99.69mm and August receives 77.55mm. (https://weatherandclimate.com/ecuador/orellana/boca-tiputini) 
Put project description here (field sites, time frame of collection,sampling scheme, type of data (eg. species ID,temp, etc.) )

Surveys: Herpetofauna were sampled using visual surveys on foot by two surveyors/night. Trail systems at each site served as the sampling paths. The surveys were repeated around 6 times on each rotation while in the field, and resampled on the second rotations. The surveys typically began around 20:00-20:30 and lasted until 23:00-00:00 CST. At each site, habitat matches were compared and assessed and trails through that habitat were consistently walked. Two different types of habitat, Terra Firma (uplands) and Varzea (flooded forest) were surveyed on the herp nocturnal walks. In addition to this, two significant bodies of water were also surveyed at each site, primarily consisting of oxbow lakes with one year-round large pond. 

	Surveyors used FENIX HM60R headlamps while conducting night surveys. They carefully examined all surrounding habitat, including understory trees, shrubs, vines, water bodies, forest floor, and middle-canopy. Amphibians of the order Anura gave off reflective eyeshine and were easier to sample for, whereas members of Squamata did not. More information about this will be within the discussion section. Effort hours will be calculated based on survey time length and number of surveyors. 

	Additionally, environmental information was taken throughout the course of each survey. Temperature and humidity data was collected with a Mengshen meter in 30 minute intervals on surveys. Understory vegetation density was also measured every 15 minutes along each trail. A 1.5m PVC pipe was randomly placed upright just off the right side of the trail at each measuring point, and the number of leaves making contact with the pipe was counted. 

	Weather and wind were noted before each survey in four nominal categories, with weather either being “clear, partly cloudy, cloudy, rainy” and wind being “no wind, felt on face, branches move, trees move”. I also accounted for precipitation that had already occurred in 6-hour blocks as “time window of last rain event”. 

	Once an animal was found, the first step of the protocol was to note what time of night the find occurred. After this, the temperature and humidity was once again collected. A rangefinder was used to estimate the perpendicular distance of each animal from the trail. A GPS was used to mark and log the coordinates of each animal found. Animals were given a two-letter code based on the Order and Suborder followed by a number, indicating its position of being found. For example, the code of the 9th snake found of the season would be SK09. Species found were also identified to the lowest taxonomic level in the field, and photographs of individuals were taken both to get positive IDs later in the lab when not possible in the field, but also to avoid counting re-captures.

	Snakes found during non-survey times were also recorded. These individuals were split into one of two categories of detection. The first is an “Opportunistic Encounter” (OE), which is any snake that was found by me while out working on other non-herpetofauna projects in the field. The other type of detection is the Third Party Encounter (TPE). This was any snake that was found by other research groups during my rotations at each station, identified to lowest possible taxonomy. The same data was taken for these individuals. GPS coordinates, time of detection, trail, observer, estimation of distance from trail, and habitat type. Because the third-party observers often didn’t have access to the climate data logger, this information was retrieved later on from each station’s respective weather tower data, based on the time of detection. 

Snakes were given a classification as to whether they were small mammal consumers or not. Information on this was retrieved from literature such as online publications, the book Reptiles and Amphibians of the Amazon by R.D. and Patricia Bartlett, and the expert field book Reptiles of Ecuador.

## Cleaning V.1

```{r preliminary data cleaning}

# Start with the surveyed snakes, season 1

snake.sur1 <- snake.sur1[-2, ] #remove row 2, as it is blank
colnames(snake.sur1) <- snake.sur1[1, ] #takes 1st row and makes it column names
snake.sur1 <- snake.sur1[-1, ] #removed extra row that originally had column names but were now useless

# Season 2 surveyed snakes doesn't need much cleaning since we based datasheet off clean version from season 1


# Time to clean the non-survey snake data

colnames(snake.nonsur1) <- snake.nonsur1[1, ] #takes row 1 and makes them column names 
snake.nonsur1 <- snake.nonsur1[-1, ] #removing first row since one is the same as column names now

# Once again, season 2 nonsurveyed snakes doesn't need much cleaning since we based datasheet off clean version from season 1

# Finally, time for environmental data

colnames(enviro1) <- enviro1[1, ] #make top row the new column headers
enviro1 <- enviro1[-1, ] #now removes useless first row

# Once again, season 2 environment doesn't need much cleaning since we based datasheet off clean version from season 1



#Compare column names, we need to get them to match season-to-season for three types of sheets
colnames(snake.sur1)
colnames(snake.sur2) #some differences that need to be addressed

snake.sur1$Size <- NA #add column for size, added for season 2
snake.sur1 <- snake.sur1 %>%
  rename(Snake_ID = Reptile_ID) #making sure both dataframes have 'Snake ID' as column

names(snake.sur1) <- gsub("_", " ", names(snake.sur1)) #getting rid of all "_" to fix an error
names(snake.sur1) <- trimws(names(snake.sur1)) #remove trailing spaces in column names
names(snake.sur1) <- gsub(" ", "_", names(snake.sur1)) #now put the underscores back

names(snake.sur2) <- gsub("_", " ", names(snake.sur2)) #getting rid of all "_" to fix an error
names(snake.sur2) <- trimws(names(snake.sur2)) #remove trailing spaces in column names
names(snake.sur2) <- gsub(" ", "_", names(snake.sur2))
snake.sur2 <- snake.sur2[, -c(3, 9)] #remove columns for 'Gross ID' and 'Survey Type'

colnames(snake.sur1)
colnames(snake.sur2) #looks good




#Now for non-surveyed data

colnames(snake.nonsur1)
colnames(snake.nonsur2) #lots of problems

snake.nonsur1 <- snake.nonsur1[, -6] #removing 'Zone' column
names(snake.nonsur1) <- trimws(names(snake.nonsur1)) #remove trailing spaces in headers
snake.nonsur1$Size <- NA #make 'Size' column as it's a new addition, populate with NA

snake.nonsur2 <- snake.nonsur2 %>%
  rename(Size = Size_Estimate) #change name of 'Size_Estimate' column to just 'Size'

colnames(snake.nonsur1)
colnames(snake.nonsur2) #looks good





#Finally, environment

colnames(enviro1)
colnames(enviro2) #ooh rough

names(enviro1) <- trimws(names(enviro1)) #to start, remove trailing spaces
enviro1$Understory_Density_Final <- NA
enviro1$Humidity_8 <- NA
enviro1$Humidity_Final <- NA
enviro1$Temperature_8 <- NA
enviro1$Temperature_Final <- NA #all these columns that didn't exist at first now do, filled with NA

enviro2 <- enviro2[, -c(45, 46)] #this one's easy, remove these weird blank columns
enviro2 <- enviro2[, -3] #and remove the column that has 'Survey Type' as they are all night 

colnames(enviro1)
colnames(enviro2) #looks good

```


## Binding Dataframes from Both Seasons

```{r combining sheets between seasons}

#Now we want to combine each pair, this chunk can be ignored if we want to analzye seasons separately but a new chunk will have to be added for just the data

snakes.sur <- rbind(snake.sur1, snake.sur2) #surveys

snakes.nonsur <- rbind(snake.nonsur1, snake.nonsur2) #nonsurveys

enviro <- rbind(enviro1, enviro2) #environment sheet

#Let's clean out the R environment a bit

rm(snake.sur1)
rm(snake.sur2)
rm(snake.nonsur1)
rm(snake.nonsur2)
rm(enviro1)
rm(enviro2)

``` 


## Cleaning V.2

```{r more advanced data cleaning for species and diet guilds}


# Standardize species names in both datasets by making function to clean them
clean_categories <- function(category) {
  category <- trimws(category)             # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
  category <- str_replace_all(category, "\\s+", "_") # Replace all internal whitespace with underscores             
  return(category)
} #this function removes trailing spaces/bad whitespace and replaces internal with underscore, and then returns the new correct 'Species'

snakes.sur$Species <- clean_categories(snakes.sur$Species) #populate new columns with function ran on current values
snakes.nonsur$Species <- clean_categories(snakes.nonsur$Species) #populate new columns with function ran on current values

# Check unique values to make sure the function works

unique(snakes.sur$Species)
unique(snakes.nonsur$Species) #looks correct



#Also want to clean the "Diet Type" column, since it shows that there are more than just 3 unique and one NA value for each dataframe and shows some repeats

unique(snakes.sur$Diet_Type)
unique(snakes.sur$Diet_Type) #idk why this happened but we need to fix it


snakes.sur$Diet_Type <- clean_categories(snakes.sur$Diet_Type) #populate new columns with function ran on current values
snakes.nonsur$Diet_Type <- clean_categories(snakes.nonsur$Diet_Type) #populate new columns with function ran on current values

# Check unique values to make sure the function works

unique(snakes.sur$Diet_Type)
unique(snakes.nonsur$Diet_Type) #looks good

# Also do it for common names
snakes.sur$Common_Name <- clean_categories(snakes.sur$Common_Name)
snakes.nonsur$Common_Name <- clean_categories(snakes.nonsur$Common_Name) #should be fixed

unique(snakes.sur$Common_Name)
unique(snakes.nonsur$Common_Name) #looks good


# Miscellaneous cleaning

snakes.sur$Date <- gsub("\\*", "", snakes.sur$Date) #getting rid of asterisks in dates
snakes.nonsur$Type_of_Encounter <- sub("\\*$", "", snakes.nonsur$Type_of_Encounter) #also an asterisk on Kai's observation, needs to be gone

# OK now all the weird important stuff should be fixed, BUT THIS CHUNK CAN BE ADDED TO WHEN I NEED TO FIX DUPLICATES IN WEATHER, WIND, ETC.

```


## Formatting Dates

```{r fixing dates surveys and non-surveys}

# tell R that the Date column are Dates as an object, not a jumble of characters

snakes.sur$Date <- as.Date(snakes.sur$Date, format = "%m/%d/%y")
snakes.nonsur$Date <- as.Date(snakes.nonsur$Date, format = "%m/%d/%y")
enviro$Date <-  as.Date(enviro$Date, format = "%m/%d/%y")

```

## Making Master CSV

```{r preparing for snake master sheet}

#Time to make one giant dataset with all snakes, but needs to be prepped first

snakes.sur$Type_of_Encounter <- "Survey" #add new column for Type of Encounter since normally not associated with other observations, fill with 'Survey'

colnames(snakes.sur)[4] <- "Location"
colnames(snakes.nonsur)[3] <- "Location" # making both spatial references into simply 'Location'

snakes.nonsur$Survey_Start_Time <- NA
snakes.nonsur$Surveyors <- NA
snakes.nonsur$Survey_End_Time <- NA #adding these columns so I can match up both dataframes


snakes.nonsur$Distance_From_Trail_m <- NA #adding this column, populating with NAs

snakes.sur$During_My_Rotation <- "Yes" #adding this column, populating with 'Yes' since all survey snakes are during my rotation

snakes.sur$Start_Date <- as.Date(snakes.sur$Date, format = "%m/%d/%y") #adding column called start date to survey data since we need an end date as well for surveys ending past midnight (which we'll deal with in next chunk)
snakes.sur$Method_of_Detection <- "Found on survey" #filling in this new column


snakes.nonsur$Start_Date <- NA 
snakes.nonsur$Trail_Walked <- NA 
snakes.nonsur$Survey_Start_Time <- NA
snakes.nonsur$Survey_End_Time <- NA
snakes.nonsur$Notes <- NA #adding these columns to make the dataframes the same to merge

snake.master <- rbind(snakes.sur, snakes.nonsur) #making master dataframe with all snakes


snake.master$Start_Date <- as.Date(snake.master$Start_Date, format = "%m%d%y") #fixing the date to stay in date format after binding (not sure if this is needed???)

snake.master$Species <- str_replace_all(snake.master$Species, " ", "_") #making sure all snakes have underscored between genus and species

unique(snake.master$Species) #make sure there are no duplicates (thank god there aren't)

# make a genus column

snake.master <- snake.master %>%
 separate(Species, c("Genus", "Species"))
# Separates genus and species, in cases where the species is unknown, populates the species column with NA (warning message)

#making new master csv, ensuring that extra row names are not added by R, this is why we can now comment out this chunk (UNSURE)

write.csv(snake.master, "snake.master.csv", row.names = FALSE) #now we have our new csv


```


## Starting to Look at Sample Effort (Time & Distance)

```{r survey samp effort}

#sursnakes <- snake.master %>%
  #filter(Type_of_Encounter == "Survey") #piping with dplyr, make new dataframe with only surveyed snakes since those are only obs. with effort associated (not sure if this is needed since effort hours is now its own column)


#Now we want to put in an environment sheet because it has our effort hours, and we want to convert those to usable numeric values

enviro$Effort <- sapply(strsplit(enviro$Searching_Time, ":"), function(x) {
  as.numeric(x[1]) + as.numeric(x[2]) / 60
}) #not really sure how this function works (from internet) but it makes the hours go from 2:30 to 2.50 hours, etc. 

#Also want to see what the distance effort is

class(enviro$Meters) #says it is a character and can't be summed, we need to convert it
enviro$Meters <- as.numeric(enviro$Meters) #now they are numbers

sum(enviro$Meters[enviro$Station == "TBS"]) # 73,864 meters at TBS
sum(enviro$Meters[enviro$Station == "YRS"]) # 76,915 meters at YRS

```


## Small Mammal Detections

```{r small mammal detection rate data}

 # add the n small mammals found per survey to the snake.sur dataframe because that has the effort hours already in it

# subset data - just want the n small mammmals and keep the date column to join by

  select(Station, Date, Number_of_Small_Mammals_Spotted, Trail_Walked, Order) #creating temporary dataframe with just these parameters

small.mamms.temp$Number_of_Small_Mammals_Spotted <-  as.numeric(small.mamms.temp$Number_of_Small_Mammals_Spotted) #changing the n small mammals to a number from a character (idk why it was a character)
class(small.mamms.temp$Number_of_Small_Mammals_Spotted) #looks correct now

# isolate effort hours per survey
effort <- enviro %>%
  select(Date, Meters, Searching_Time, Effort) #put both meters and time to see how they impact rates of detection

# join effort to small mamms
small.mamms.temp <- left_join(small.mamms.temp, effort)

# get rid of nas (don't think there are any)
small.mamms.temp <- small.mamms.temp %>%
  na.omit()

# clean
